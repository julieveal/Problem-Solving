//I have 4 to choose from. The wheel needs to be the same height as the tire. 


var height = prompt("What is the height of your photograph in pixels?");		// 8 inches wide
	height = 10;	//10 inches high
	size = width * height;		//multiply 8 by 10

	console.log(size);  //calculate

/*if(tireC == bikeHeight){   //they are the same number

}else{							     		//otherwise
